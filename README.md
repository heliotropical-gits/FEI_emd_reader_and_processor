# FEI .emd microscopy file image processor and analysis
----------------------

Basic python scripts to quickly produce images and data out of an FEI .emd microscope data file,
which contains both a simple image and spectral data on chemical element concentrations.

Built for a tutorial given in April 2018, and also for fun.
